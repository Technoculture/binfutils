The Padlock Probe Designer CLI is a command-line tool developed in Python using the Click library and Biopython module. It enables users to design Padlock Probes by automating the process of downloading data from miRBase and salivaDB, converting them into CSV format, performing analysis, filtering, and generating Padlock Probes. This README provides a detailed overview of the project and guides users on how to install, set up, and utilize the CLI effectively.
